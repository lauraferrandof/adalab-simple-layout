# Adalab: a simple responsive layout

This is a mid-term evaluation exercise for the first sprint in [Adalab](https://adalab.es/). The main goal of this exercise was to self-assess my knowledge and skills in basic HTML5 and CSS3 after one week in the program. I received my teacher's feedback on my work and had the chance to improve the exercise.

It's a simple responsive layout created using flexbox.

I'm still learning so please, if you spot a bug, want to improve my code or just show me another way to do things, don't hesitate to open an issue or send a PR!
